invited to project (group insinuated... for beta)

States:

  1.
    A. Task.create :title => "#{invitation.inviter} invited you to join #{project.name}"
      i. inviter.avatar is shown for this entity
    B. Form.create :first_name, :last_name, :email... 

  2.
    A. Milestone.create :title => "Registration 50% complete!" 
    B. Form.create :timezone, :text...
      i. must handle file upload, which will eventually live in the jQuery template

  3.
    A. Milestone.create :title => "Registration 100% complete!" 
    B. One-off Entity to take you to Project, is fed project.id


Things I'm missing:

  Quick:
  X Milestone < Entity

  Involved:
  X Form < Entity

  X Invitation
  X Invitation Email

  - Phase
    - state

  - Workflow
    - vars

  - One-off Entity to take you to Project, is fed project.id


Finished when:
  1 there is a registration workflow 
    - can be instantiated for a given group
  2 registration timeline is made up of stages
    - stages detect when previous step is complete

========================
Phases...

Project has_many :phases

Phase has_many :entities
attr title, text, state
