invited to project (group insinuated... for beta)

States:

  1.
    A. Task.create :title => "#{invitation.inviter} invited you to join #{project.name}"
      i. inviter.avatar is shown for this entity
    B. Form.create :first_name, :last_name, :email... 

  2.
    A. Milestone.create :title => "Registration 50% complete!" 
    B. Form.create :timezone, :text...
      i. must handle file upload, which will eventually live in the jQuery template

  3.
    A. Milestone.create :title => "Registration 100% complete!" 
    B. One-off Entity to take you to Project, is fed project.id


Things I'm missing:

  Quick:
  - Milestone < Entity

  Involved:
  - Form < Entity

  - Invitation
  - Invitation Email

  - Phase
  - Phase.state

  - One-off Entity to take you to Project, is fed project.id


Pre-requires:
  - Phases
  - Email/Invitation
  - Workflow

Requires:
  - Milestone
  - Form
